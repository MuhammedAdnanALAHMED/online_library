we will create a master page in ASP.NET. We will create the basic template in the master page by adding the navigation links & footer links & also do its styling.
What is Master Page in ASP.NET ?
Master pages allow you to create a consistent look and behavior for all the pages (or group of pages) in your web application.
A master page provides a template for other pages, with shared layout and functionality. The master page defines placeholders for the content, which can be overridden by content pages. The output result is a combination of the master page and the content page.
The content pages contain the content you want to display.
When users request the content page, ASP.NET merges the pages to produce output that combines the layout of the master page with the content of the content page.
We will create the static home page in asp.net & also do its styling using bootstrap framework.
In this tutorial we will design the admin book issuing page using ASP.net & also apply bootstrap styling. By this module the admin/librarian will be able to issue library books to members. We will only design the front-end design in this tutorial & add backend code later.
In this tutorial we will design the admin book inventory page using ASP.NET & also apply bootstrap styling. By this module the admin/librarian will be able to add/update & delete books which they have in their library.
